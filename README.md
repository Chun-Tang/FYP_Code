# FYP_Code
The code used for my Imperial College London Final Year Project: Assessing drought stress in Arabidopsis thaliana: stomatal aperture quantification and drought stress intensity clustering.

HDBSCAN - Code and dataset used for clustering
COD_Model - COD model from https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s13007-017-0244-9. Changed for my file directories and to output a .csv file containing the aperture measurement results.
