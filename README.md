# FYP_Code
The code used for my Imperial College London Final Year Project: Assessing drought stress in Arabidopsis thaliana: stomatal aperture quantification and drought stress intensity clustering.

HDBSCAN - Code and dataset used for clustering

COD_Model - COD model from https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s13007-017-0244-9. Changed for my file directories and to output a .csv file containing the aperture measurement results. COD Model can be downloaded from: https://drive.google.com/file/d/129nyzdxben5gUaeUe739vjZ2eo-uK8eD/view?usp=sharing <br/>[Jayakody, H., Liu, S., Whitty, M. et al. Microscope image based fully automated stomata detection and pore measurement method for grapevines. Plant Methods 13, 94 (2017). https://doi.org/10.1186/s13007-017-0244-9].
 
YOLOX Model - YOLOX model from https://academic.oup.com/pcp/article/64/11/1301/7082629. Code was edited to take inputs from a folder I uploaded and output results in another folder. Fixed an issue where the automatically generated .ipynb_checkpoints file was treated as an input, stopping the code from working. Google Colab Notebook to use model with my edits: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1J-0fPjZfVeY8svWBcGw9zesUoTTzWsEX?usp=sharing [Momoko Takagi, Rikako Hirata, Yusuke Aihara, Yuki Hayashi, Miya Mizutani-Aihara, Eigo Ando, Megumi Yoshimura-Kono, Masakazu Tomiyama, Toshinori Kinoshita, Akira Mine, Yosuke Toda, Image-Based Quantification of Arabidopsis thaliana Stomatal Aperture from Leaf Images, Plant and Cell Physiology, Volume 64, Issue 11, November 2023, Pages 1301â€“1310, https://doi.org/10.1093/pcp/pcad018]. . 

LeafNet - LeafNet model used following manual instructions from https://leafnet.whu.edu.cn/ through Ubuntu 20.04.6 LTS. Inputs I used can be found in the LeafNet folder [Li S, Li L, Fan W, Ma S, Zhang C, Kim JC, Wang K, Russinova E, Zhu Y, Zhou Y. LeafNet: a tool for segmenting and quantifying stomata and pavement cells. Plant Cell. 2022 Mar 29;34(4):1171-1188. doi: 10.1093/plcell/koac021. PMID: 35080620; PMCID: PMC8972303.].
